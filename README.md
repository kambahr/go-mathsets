# A Go implementation of the Merkle Tree

## Get a Merkle Root or browse an entire merkle tree of a data-set

### Functions
There are two primary functions. One gets the entire tree and other only returns the merkle root (faster).

``` go
// GetMerkleTree returns the entire tree; with leaves, all the branches and the root of the tree.
func GetMerkleTree(nodes []string) (MerkleTree, error)

// GetMerkleRoot returns the Merkle root of an array of string.
func GetMerkleRoot(nodes []string) (string, error)
```

### Demo App
Run the test app to see a demo of the usage.

#### Usage example from a Bitcoin Block 
Verify the calculation of the merkle root by comparing to the published merkle root of block 
``` bash
000000000003ba27aa200b1cecaad478d2b00432346c3f1f3986da1afd33e506
```
of the Bitcoin Block Chain.


#### Detect changes in a set
Take a merkle root of a set; change a value in the set; and then tell if the set has changed without having to inspect all data -- demonstrated by demoDataChanged().

#### Performance Comparison with Hash

demoHashVsMerkelRoot() compares the calculation time between merkle root and just getting a hash.
